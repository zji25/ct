"So what really happend on the bridge?
 During one of PewDiePie's live streams. PewDiePie was playing a video game, and in frustration, he used a racial slur. The specific word he used was a racial slur commonly directed at people of African descent. The incident sparked immediate controversy and criticism.

PewDiePie later issued an apology on his YouTube channel, acknowledging the inappropriateness of his language and expressing regret for using such a derogatory term. He stated that he was not trying to justify his words and that he understood the impact of his actions.

This incident had consequences for PewDiePie's business relationships. Following the controversy, the developers of the game he was playing, Firewatch, requested that he not play or stream their games in the future. Additionally, he faced criticism from various media outlets and the broader online community.

It's worth noting that this incident was part of a series of controversies surrounding PewDiePie during that time, including the aforementioned anti-Semitic content controversy. While he maintained a massive following, these incidents prompted discussions about responsibility and accountability among content creators on platforms like YouTube.

"I don't hate the video but at the same time I hate this video because it makes me feel lonely and jelous of how beautiful the family Pewds have. From being his 9 years old to 19 years old army. Now we grow up, some of us is already married, probably most of us already have a job continuing life. This also makes me feel very nostalgic, from my age come back from school watching Pewds playing games daily, waiting for his 'friday with pewdiepie' every week, to the day he finally married Marzia. It feels like a slice-of-life wholesome anime but it actually real. This probably my last comment in this channel and I'd like to say from the bottom of my heart, Thank You Pewds for being an entertainment of childhood, it was a good journey.

I don't really think he would read this comment but at least I could send my (probably final) message to my childhood hero. Who knows~",0,0

"Felix ive been a subscriber for about 11 years,maybe longer. I was 16/17. I grew up living with an abusive mother and I watched you because she completely isolated me from everyone including my father. I watched your videos as an escape and eventually you became someone I looked up to because you shared yourself to complete strangers daily. I was reminded everyday that my interests fun and exciting. And that there’s is plenty of love and kindness in the world and my existence is proof of it. 

While in the process of trying to repair things with my father, he fell victim to suicide in December of 2020. I saw him for thanksgiving and he was gone a week later. He had battled Hodgkin’s lymphoma twice. The second time took such an intense toll on his mental health, and after remission he convinced himself that he would not be able to go through another year of treatment if was to return a 3rd time. 

Your videos have helped the past year, and especially now that the anniversary of his death is nearing. Thank you for continuing to be a bright light. And that goes for your whole little family as well💖",2,0

"I usually don't comment on videos but I've been following Felix since the very beginning. And I have loved every minute of it. Being able to grow up alongside him and his little family, has to be one of the top tier priviliges in my life. 

It's wonderful when he speaks swedish to Björn. I love hearing a neighbouring scandinavian language on such an ""English"" channel.

I hope he never stops making videos, at least not completely. I would feel that a small part of me had gone missing, if he ever decided to quit completely.

All the best to you and your family, from me and from us in your HUGE family.

Big pp's till the end!",2,0

The city itself has a post-glory ‘bubble era’ feel to it but the view from that hillside makes up for it. And there is actually a really cool art museum (MOA) not far from whew Felix & family were, I think. And excellent seafood, onsens, and local, craft beer… OK I’ll stop now. Anyway, Izu peninsula is all pretty awesome — check it out if you’re in that area of Japan!! 🍻",292,0

"5:57 

The statement ""Don't drop the baby. This is the chance"" can be considered a highly inappropriate and irresponsible communication tactic. It combines a serious warning about the safety of a child with a seemingly unrelated and ambiguous statement (""This is the chance""), creating confusion and potential danger.

Effective communication should prioritize clarity, especially when it comes to matters of safety. Mixing a warning about not dropping a baby with a vague or unclear follow-up can lead to misunderstanding and, in this case, may even jeopardize the well-being of the child.",0,0

Thank you so much for sharing all of this with us because, like so many of us, I have been around for many years and I truly enjoy seeing you so happy and it makes me happy to still get to watch your videos. 
I think a lot of people have their own “comfort” YouTubers and for about 10 years now it’s been you and Jack. I have several other YouTubers I watch and enjoy but you and Jack have always meant so much to me. You’ve been there for me during some extremely dark times without even knowing it. I’m so grateful. Much love to you and your family. 
I also wondered if the monkey was enjoying it. When I see people using monkeys as a form of entertainment, sure it’s cute, but is it best for the monkey? Probably not in most cases. I hope they treat him/her well and take care of it properly.

"I wrote a message quite some time ago about my wife who had a bad type of cancer in her spine 2016 and about our dream going to Japan and how these kind of videos has made it so it almost feels like we have been there, and i just wanted to share an update. 

Shes healthier than ever and 1 month ago we received our first baby <3, a little girl. My wife had a 50/50 chance of being paralyzed from the waist down and they said that the cancer would most likely appear again within just a couple of years due to it being incredibly aggresive, and the odds of us ever getting a baby the natural way was very unlikely due to the very heavy treatments she went on. Fast forward to 2023, we have a babygirl, 2 dogs a house, both of us are very health and living our best life. So to all of you fighters out there, as long as there is life, there is hope, keep fighting. 

Thanks for these videos Felix, me and Caroline love them.",97,0
